# BIT2207-Assignment2 - Building an Animation or Simulation System

The simulation of objects and beings within a computer has become a hot topic over the last few years, with applications to        virtual reality, the design of safe stadia, synthetic actors and environments for films, and computer games, amongst others. 

This project would look at the design and construction of a relatively simple animation or simulation system, that would probably sacrifice ease of animation in order to focus on the modelling of interactions between the actors and their environments.

Such a project would probably make use of existing collision detection code within the computing laboratory, coupled with algorithms that simulate the physical interaction of bodies. (An alternative would be to use one of the physical modelling APIs that are now becoming available.)
